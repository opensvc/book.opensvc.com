# Introduction

## What is OpenSVC

OpenSVC is an open-source software product and the name of the company developing and supporting it. In production since 2009, OpenSVC consists of:

- **Agent**: A supervisor, clusterware, container orchestrator, and configuration manager (Apache 2.0 licensed since v3).
- **Collector**: Aggregates agent data and manages configuration, infrastructure, and resources (Apache 2.0 licensed).

### Key Features:
- **Service Mobility**: Ensures high availability and scalability.
- **Configuration Management**: Handles thousands of servers and clusters with minimal dependencies.
- **Inventoring**: Tracks assets, storage, networks, and services.
- **Orchestration**: RESTful API, self-service portal, provisioning, fine-grained delegation.
- **Auditing**: Monitors performance, alerts, and audits infrastructure and services.
- **Productivity Boost**: Reduces infrastructure maintenance and allows for task delegation.

OpenSVC is OS, application, and hardware agnostic.
