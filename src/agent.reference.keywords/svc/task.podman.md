	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	rbac:        Triggers require the root grant.

**Description:**

A command or script to execute before the resource `run` action.

Errors interrupt the action.


## Keyword `blocking_pre_stop`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	rbac:        Triggers require the root grant.

**Description:**

A command or script to execute before the resource `stop` action.

Errors interrupt the action.


## Keyword `blocking_pre_unprovision`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	rbac:        Triggers require the root grant.

**Description:**

A command or script to execute before the resource `unprovision` action.

Errors interrupt the action.


## Keyword `check`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	candidates:  last_run, last_run_warn, 

**Example:**

	check=last_run

**Description:**

If set to `last_run`, the last run retcode is used to report a task resource
status.

If set to `last_run_warn`, the last run error retcode is displayed as a
resource warning.

If not set (default), the status of a task is always n/a.


## Keyword `command`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	aliases:     run_command
	convert:     shlex

**Example:**

	command=/opt/tomcat/bin/catalina.sh

**Description:**

The command to execute in the docker container on run.


## Keyword `comment`

	required:    false
	scopable:    false

**Description:**

A free form text describing the role of the object, of the node, or of the
section it is set in.

The keyword is accepted in any section, so the DEFAULT section can document a
configuration as a whole, and a resource, pool, heartbeat, array or network
section can document itself.

The agent does not interpret the value.


## Keyword `configs_environment`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	convert:     shlex

**Example:**

	configs_environment=PORT=http/port webapp/app1* {name}/* {name}-debug/settings

**Description:**

A whitespace-separated list of `<var>=<cfg name>/<key path>` or
`<cfg name>/<key matcher>`.

If the `cfg` or config key doesn't exist then `start` and `stop` actions on
the resource will fail with a non 0 exit code.

A shell expression splitter is applied, so double quotes can be around
`<cfg name>/<key path>` only or whole `<var>=<cfg name>/<key path>`.

Example with,

* `<ns>/cfg/nginx` a config having a `user` key with value `user1`.

* `<ns>/cfg/cfg1` a config having a `key1` key with value `val1`.

`configs_environment = NGINX_USER=nginx/user cfg1/*` creates the following
variables in the container command execution environment:

	NGINX_USER=user1
	key1=val1



## Keyword `confirmation`

	required:    false
	scopable:    false
	convert:     bool

**Description:**

If set to `true`, ask for an interactive confirmation to run the task.

This flag can be used for dangerous tasks like data restoration.


## Keyword `cwd`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true

**Example:**

	cwd=/opt/foo

**Description:**

The current working directory set for the executed command.


## Keyword `devices`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	convert:     shlex
	rbac:        Host devices in container require the root grant.

**Example:**

	devices=myvol1:/dev/xvda myvol2:/dev/xvdb

**Description:**

The whitespace-separated list of `<host devpath>:<containerized devpath>`
exposing host devices as container devices.


## Keyword `disable`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	convert:     bool

**Description:**

A disabled resource will be ignored on `start`, `stop`, `provision` and
`unprovision` actions.

A disabled resource status is `n/a`.

If set in the `DEFAULT` section of an object, the object is disabled and
ignores `start`, `stop`, `shutdown`, `provision` and `unprovision` actions.

These actions immediately return success.

`om <path> disable` sets `DEFAULT.disable=true`.

`om <path> enable` sets `DEFAULT.disable=false`.

> **Note**: The `enable` and `disable` actions preserve the individual
  resource `disable` state.


## Keyword `dns`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	convert:     list
	rbac:        Requires the root grant.

**Example:**

	dns=1.1.1.1 8.8.8.8

**Description:**

The whitespace-separated list of nameservers to add to the resolver of the
container, after the nameservers of the cluster.

om writes the `/etc/resolv.conf` of the container itself and mounts it, so the
`--dns` argument of the container engine is not used and one set in `run_args`
is dropped.

A resolver reads the first three nameservers of a file and ignores the rest, so
a cluster already naming three leaves no room here, and the ones dropped are
named in a warning at start.


## Keyword `dns_search`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	convert:     list
	rbac:        Requires the root grant.

**Example:**

	dns_search=opensvc.com

**Description:**

The whitespace-separated list of DNS domains to search for shortname lookups.

If empty or not set, the list will be `<name>.<namespace>.svc.<clustername>
 <namespace>.svc.<clustername> svc.<clustername>`.


## Keyword `encap`

	required:    false
	scopable:    false
	convert:     bool

**Description:**

Set to `true` to ignore this resource in the nodes context and consider it in the encapnodes context. The resource is thus handled by agents deployed in the service containers.


## Keyword `entrypoint`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	convert:     shlex

**Example:**

	entrypoint=/bin/sh

**Description:**

The script or binary executed in the container.

The entrypoint args must be set in `command`.


## Keyword `environment`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	convert:     shlex

**Example:**

	environment=KEY=cert1/server.key PASSWORD=db/password

**Description:**

A whitespace-separated list of `<var>=<value>`.

A shell expression splitter is applied, so double quotes can be around
`<value>` only or whole `<var>=<value>`.


## Keyword `guest_os`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	aliases:     guestos
	candidates:  unix, windows
	default:     unix

**Example:**

	guest_os=unix

**Description:**

The name of the operating system in the virtual machine.


## Keyword `hostname`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true

**Example:**

	hostname=nginx1

**Description:**

Set the container hostname. If not set, a unique id is used.


## Keyword `image`

	required:    true
	scopable:    true
	aliases:     run_image

**Example:**

	image=ghcr.io/opensvc/pause

**Description:**

The docker image pull, and run the container with.


## Keyword `image_pull_policy`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	candidates:  once, always

**Example:**

	image_pull_policy=once

**Description:**

The docker image pull policy.

* `always`

  Pull upon each container start.

* `once`

  Pull if not already pulled (default).


## Keyword `init`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	default:     true
	convert:     bool

**Description:**

Run an init inside the container that forwards signals and reaps processes.


## Keyword `interactive`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	convert:     bool

**Description:**

Keep stdin open even if not attached.

To use if the container entrypoint is a shell.


## Keyword `ipcns`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true

**Example:**

	ipcns=container#0

**Description:**

* empty

  The docker daemon's default value is used.

*  `none`

  Do not mount /dev/shm.

* `private`

  Create a ipcns other containers can not share.


* `shareable`

   Create a ipcns other containers can share.

* `container#<i>`

   Share the `container#<i>` ipcns.


## Keyword `log`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	default:     true
	convert:     bool

**Description:**

Log the task outputs in the service log.


## Keyword `max_parallel`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	default:     1
	convert:     int

**Example:**

	max_parallel=2

**Description:**

Support limited, concurrent runs of tasks.

The task#xx.max_parallel=2 setting limits the number of concurrent task runs to 2.

The default value is 1, ensuring backward compatibility.

The run count is determined based on PID files created in the `<resource var>/run/` directories.

The PID file is normally removed when the task execution ends, but if the executor dies abruptly (e.g., due to a SIGKILL), the stale PID file is not considered when computing the resource status. It is removed before the count check of the next run.

Staleness is evaluated using the condition: (PID file mtime < process birth time).

A new status log message may appear to indicate that the maximum concurrency limit has been reached.


## Keyword `monitor`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	convert:     bool

**Description:**

A resource with `monitor=true` will trigger the `monitor_action`
(crash or reboot the node, freezestop or switch the service) if:

* The resource is `down`.

* The instance has `local_expect=started` in its daemon monitor data, which
  means the daemon considers this instance is and should remain started.

* All restart tentatives failed.


## Keyword `name`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true

**Default:**

Autogenerated using a `<namespace>..<object name>.container.<resource index>`
template.

**Example:**

	name=osvcprd..rundeck.container.db

**Description:**

The name to assign to the container on `docker run`.

If not set, a `<namespace>..<name>.container.<rid idx>` name is automatically
assigned.


## Keyword `netns`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	aliases:     net
	rbac:        The host network namespace requires the root grant.

**Example:**

	netns=container#0

**Description:**

* empty or `none`

  The container has a private netns other `container`, `ip.netns` or
  `ip.cni` resources can share.

* `<rid>`

  The id of the resource that has the network namespace this container joins.

  For example, a container with `netns=container#0` will share the
  `container#0` netns.

* `host`

  Share the host network namespace.


## Keyword `on_error`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true

**Example:**

	on_error=/srv/{name}/data/scripts/task_on_error.sh

**Description:**

A command to execute on `run` action if `command` returned an error.


## Keyword `optional`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	convert:     bool

**Description:**

Action errors on optional resources are logged but do not interrupt the action sequence.

The status of optional resources is not included in the instance availability status but is considered in the overall status.

The status of task and sync resources is always included in the overall status, regardless of whether they are marked as optional.

Resources tagged as `noaction` are considered optional by default.

Dump filesystems are a typical use case for optional=true.


## Keyword `osvc_root_path`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true

**Example:**

	osvc_root_path=/opt/opensvc

**Description:**

If the OpenSVC agent is installed via package in the container, this keyword
must not be set.

Else the value can be set to the fullpath hosting the agent installed from
sources.


## Keyword `pg_blkio_weight`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true

**Example:**

	pg_blkio_weight=50

**Description:**

Block IO relative weight. Value: between `10` and `1000`.

The kernel default is `100`.

Setting this keyword to `default` puts the capping back where a node that
never capped anything leaves it. Removing the keyword does not: what was
written stays written, whether om wrote it or something else did.


## Keyword `pg_cpu_burst`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true

**Example:**

	pg_cpu_burst=20%

**Description:**

The cpu time the group banks under its quota, and spends above it.

It is the time the processes of the group may bank while under their
`pg_cpu_quota`, and spend above it in a short spike, in the notation of
`pg_cpu_quota`: `20%` lets the group run a fifth of a cpu above its quota
during a period, out of what it left unused before.

It serves a latency-sensitive service capped tightly: a request arriving
after an idle spell is served at the speed of the burst, rather than
throttled for the rest of the period. Over a longer time the group still
uses no more than its quota.

It needs `pg_cpu_quota`, and cannot exceed it: the kernel refuses a burst
larger than the quota. Only the unified cgroup hierarchy has it.

Setting this keyword to `default` puts the capping back where a node that
never capped anything leaves it. Removing the keyword does not: what was
written stays written, whether om wrote it or something else did.


## Keyword `pg_cpu_quota`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true

**Example:**

	pg_cpu_quota=50%@all

**Description:**

The percentage of cpu time the processes of the group may use.

Accepted expressions:

* `50%`
  Half of one cpu.

* `50%@all`
  Half of every cpu the node has.

* `10%@2`
  A tenth of two cpus.

Unlike `pg_cpu_shares`, which only arbitrates when the node is cpu-bound, a
quota caps the group whether or not the node is busy.

Setting this keyword to `default` puts the capping back where a node that
never capped anything leaves it. Removing the keyword does not: what was
written stays written, whether om wrote it or something else did.


## Keyword `pg_cpu_shares`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	convert:     size

**Example:**

	pg_cpu_shares=512

**Description:**

The share of cpu the group gets when the node is cpu-bound.

The share is relative to the other groups.

The actual percentile depends on the shares allowed to the other services.
Unset, the kernel default is used, which usually is 1024 shares.

Setting this keyword to `default` puts the capping back where a node that
never capped anything leaves it. Removing the keyword does not: what was
written stays written, whether om wrote it or something else did.


## Keyword `pg_cpus`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	depends:     create_pg=true

**Example:**

	pg_cpus=0-2

**Description:**

The cpus the processes of the group may run on.

Cpus are specified as list or range : `0,1,2` or `0-2`.

Setting this keyword to `default` puts the capping back where a node that
never capped anything leaves it. Removing the keyword does not: what was
written stays written, whether om wrote it or something else did.


## Keyword `pg_mem_high`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	convert:     size

**Example:**

	pg_mem_high=384m

**Description:**

The memory past which the kernel throttles the group, in bytes.

Past it, the kernel slows the processes of the group down, reclaiming their
memory and throttling their allocations.

Unlike `pg_mem_limit`, reaching it does not wake the Out-Of-Memory killer: a
group above it keeps running, slower, while the kernel reclaims. Set below
`pg_mem_limit`, it gives a process growing too much the time to be noticed,
or to shrink, before it is killed.

It is a soft limit, so it is not what a memory claim counts: the claim counts
`pg_mem_limit`. Only the unified cgroup hierarchy has it.

Setting this keyword to `default` puts the capping back where a node that
never capped anything leaves it. Removing the keyword does not: what was
written stays written, whether om wrote it or something else did.


## Keyword `pg_mem_limit`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	convert:     size

**Example:**

	pg_mem_limit=512m

**Description:**

The memory the processes of the group may use, in bytes.

The Out-Of-Memory killer is triggered in case of tresspassing.

Setting this keyword to `default` puts the capping back where a node that
never capped anything leaves it. Removing the keyword does not: what was
written stays written, whether om wrote it or something else did.


## Keyword `pg_mem_oom_control`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true

**Example:**

	pg_mem_oom_control=1

**Description:**

Whether the Out of Memory killer runs for the group: 0 enables it.

It is a flag (0 or 1) enabling or disabling the Out of Memory killer for the
processes of the group.

* If enabled (0), tasks that attempt to consume more memory than they are
  allowed are immediately killed by the OOM killer.
* If disabled (1), tasks are allowed to continue to try allocating memory,
  stressing the system.

The OOM killer is enabled by default in every cgroup using the memory
controller.

This keyword caps nothing on a node holding the unified cgroup hierarchy,
which has no `memory.oom_control`: that file is of the v1 hierarchy. Setting
it there is warned about, and ignored.


## Keyword `pg_mem_swappiness`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true

**Example:**

	pg_mem_swappiness=40

**Description:**

Set a swappiness percentile value for the process group.

This keyword caps nothing on a node holding the unified cgroup hierarchy,
which has no `memory.swappiness`: that file is of the v1 hierarchy. Setting
it there is warned about, and ignored.


## Keyword `pg_mems`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true

**Example:**

	pg_mems=0-2

**Description:**

The memory nodes the processes of the group may allocate from.

Memory nodes are specified as list or range : `0,1,2` or `0-2`.

Setting this keyword to `default` puts the capping back where a node that
never capped anything leaves it. Removing the keyword does not: what was
written stays written, whether om wrote it or something else did.


## Keyword `pg_pids_max`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true

**Example:**

	pg_pids_max=512

**Description:**

The most processes and threads the group may run at once.

A fork beyond it fails in the process that asked for it, and nothing else
of the node is touched: it is what keeps a runaway fork loop from exhausting
the process table of the node.

Setting this keyword to `default` puts the capping back where a node that
never capped anything leaves it. Removing the keyword does not: what was
written stays written, whether om wrote it or something else did.


## Keyword `pg_vmem_limit`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	convert:     size

**Example:**

	pg_vmem_limit=1g

**Description:**

The memory plus swap the processes of the group may use, in bytes.

The Out-Of-Memory killer is triggered in case of tresspassing.
The specified value must be greater than `pg_mem_limit`.

Setting this keyword to `default` puts the capping back where a node that
never capped anything leaves it. Removing the keyword does not: what was
written stays written, whether om wrote it or something else did.


## Keyword `pidns`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true

**Example:**

	pidns=container#0

**Description:**

* empty

  The container has a private pidns other containers can share.
  Usually a pidns sharer will run a `pause` image to reap zombies.

* `container#<i>`

  Share  `container#<i>` pidns.

* `host`

  Share the host's pidns.


## Keyword `post_provision`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	rbac:        Triggers require the root grant.

**Description:**

## Keyword `privileged`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	convert:     bool
	rbac:        A privileged container requires the root grant.

**Description:**

Give extended privileges to the container.


## Keyword `provision`

	required:    false
	scopable:    false
	default:     true
	convert:     bool

**Description:**

Set to `false` to ignore the `provision` and `unprovision` actions on the
resource.

> **Warning**: `provision` and `unprovision` use data-destructive operations
  like formatting.

It is recommended to set `provision=false` on long-lived critical objects,
to force administrators to remove this setting when they really want to
destroy data.


## Keyword `provision_requires`

	required:    false
	scopable:    false

**Example:**

	provision_requires=ip#0 fs#0(down,stdby down)

**Description:**

	convert:     tristate

**Description:**

Mount the root filesystem of the task container as read only.

The task writes only in its volume mounts and its tmpfs, as a container
declaring the same keyword does.


## Keyword `registry_creds`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true

**Example:**

	registry_creds=creds-registry-opensvc-com

**Description:**

The name of a secret in the same namespace having a `config.json` key which
value is used to login to the container image registry.

If not specified, the node-level registry credential store is used.


## Keyword `retcodes`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	default:     0:up 1:down

**Example:**

	retcodes=0:up 1:down 3:warn 4: n/a 5:undef

**Description:**

The whitespace-separated list of `<retcode>:<status name>`.

All undefined retcodes are mapped to the `warn` status.

Valid `<status names>` are:

* `up`
* `down`
* `warn`
* `n/a`
* `undef`


## Keyword `rm`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	convert:     bool

**Example:**

	rm=false

**Description:**

If rm=true, the container task instance is removed after successfully run.


## Keyword `rootless_group`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	since:       v3.0.0-rc42

**Example:**

	rootless_group=opensvc

**Description:**

The group podman runs a rootless container as, in place of the primary group
of rootless_user.

It has no effect without rootless_user.


## Keyword `rootless_user`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	since:       v3.0.0-rc42

**Example:**

	rootless_user=opensvc

**Description:**

The unprivileged user podman runs the task container as, making it a rootless
container. Every podman command of the container runs as that user, so the
container, its image and its store are the user's, and its processes are
mapped to the subordinate ids of the user.

The node must be set up for it, and the container refuses to start until it
is, naming what is missing:

* the systemd instance of the user must run without a login session, which
  `loginctl enable-linger <user>` makes it do,

* the user must have subordinate ids in `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid`.

The pg_* keywords cap the container in the subtree of the cgroup hierarchy
systemd delegates to the user, where podman places it. A capping whose
controller that subtree is not delegated, like pg_cpus and pg_blkio_weight
under a default `user@.service`, is reported as not applied.

The resolver of the container is written under the runtime directory of the
user, which podman can read, rather than in the var dir of the resource.

A rootless container cannot be privileged, and its volume mounts must be
readable by the user or its subordinate ids: see the userns keyword for
mapping the user into the container.

The ids of the container run as other ids of the host: its root as the user,
and its ids from 1 as the subordinate ids of the user. A file the container
reads as one of its ids is owned, on the host, by the id the reference
`{<rid>.uid.<id>}` or `{<rid>.gid.<id>}` answers, `{<rid>.uid}` being its root.
They answer the same ids for a rootful container, which runs its ids as
themselves, so an install naming its owners by reference holds either way:

    install = /etc/nginx/conf.d/ from ./cfg/web user {container#1.uid.101} group {container#1.gid.101}

A container given a userns mapping answers no id: podman makes that mapping
when the container starts.

Empty, the default, runs the container as root.


## Keyword `run_args`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	convert:     shlex
	rbac:        Requires the root grant.

**Example:**

	run_args=-v /opt/docker.opensvc.com/vol1:/vol1:rw -p 37.59.71.25:8080:8080

**Description:**

Extra arguments to pass to the docker run command, like volume and port
mappings.


## Keyword `run_requires`

	required:    false
	scopable:    false

**Example:**

	run_requires=ip#0 fs#0(down,stdby down)

**Description:**

A whitespace-separated list of conditions to meet to accept a 'run'
action.

A condition is expressed as `<rid>(<state>,...)`.

If states are omitted, `up,stdby up` is used as the default expected states.


## Keyword `run_timeout`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	convert:     duration

**Example:**

	run_timeout=1m30s

**Description:**

Wait for `<duration>` before declaring the action a failure.

Takes precedence over `timeout`.


## Keyword `schedule`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true

**Example:**

	schedule=00:00-01:00 mon

**Description:**

Set the task `run` schedule.

See `usr/share/doc/opensvc/schedule` for the schedule syntax reference.


## Keyword `secrets_environment`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	convert:     shlex

**Example:**

	secrets_environment=CRT=cert1/server.pem sec1/*

**Description:**

A whitespace-separated list of `<var>=<sec name>/<key path>` or
`<sec name>/<key matcher>`.

If the `sec` or secret key doesn't exist then `start` and `stop` actions on
the resource will fail with a non 0 exit code.

A shell expression splitter is applied, so double quotes can be around
`<sec name>/<key path>` only or whole `<var>=<sec name>/<key path>`.

Example with,

* `<ns>/sec/cert1` a secret having a `server.pem` key with value `mycrt`.

* `<ns>/sec/sec1` a secret having a `key1` key with value `val1`.

`secrets_environment = CRT=cert1/server.pem sec1/*` creates the following
variables in the container command execution environment:

	CRT=mycrt
	key1=val1



## Keyword `shared`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	convert:     bool

**Description:**

If `true`, the resource will be considered shared during provision and
unprovision actions.

A shared resource driver can implement a different behaviour depending
on weither it is run from the leader instance, or not:

* When `--leader` is set, the driver creates and configures the system
  objects. For example the disk.disk driver allocates a SAN disk and
  discover its block devices.

* When `--leader` is not set, the driver does not redo the actions
  already done by the leader, but may do some. For example, the
  disk.disk driver skips the SAN disk allocation, but discovers the
  block devices.

The daemon takes care of setting the `--leader` flags on the commands
it submits during deploy, purge, provision and unprovision
orchestrations.

> **Warning**: If admins want to submit `--local` provision or unprovision
  commands themselves, they have to set the `--leader` flag correctly.

Flex objects usually don't use shared resources. But if they do, only
the flex primary gets `--leader` commands.

> **Warning**: All resources depending on a shared resource must also be
  flagged as shared.


## Keyword `snooze`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	convert:     duration

**Example:**

	snooze=10m

**Description:**

Snooze the service before running the task, so if the command is cause a
status degradation the user can decide to snooze alarms for the duration
set as value.


## Keyword `standby`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	convert:     bool

**Description:**

If `true`, always start the resource, even on non-started instances.

The daemon is responsible for starting standby resources.

A resource can be set standby on a subset of nodes using keyword scoping.

A typical use-case is a synchronized filesystem on non-shared disks. The
remote filesystem must be mounted to not overflow the underlying filesystem.

> **Warning**: In most situation, don't set shared resources standby, a
  non-clustered fs on shared disks for example.


## Keyword `stat_timeout`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	convert:     duration

**Description:**

The fs resources status evaluation includes a stat syscall test.
This keyword defines the maximum wait time for those stat calls to respond.

When expired, the resource status is degraded is to warn, which can trigger
a monitor action (reboot or crash the node) if the resource is monitored.


## Keyword `stop_requires`

	required:    false
	scopable:    false

**Example:**

	stop_requires=ip#0 fs#0(down,stdby down)

**Description:**

A whitespace-separated list of conditions to meet to accept a 'stop'
action.

A condition is expressed as `<rid>(<state>,...)`.

If states are omitted, `up,stdby up` is used as the default expected states.


## Keyword `stop_timeout`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	convert:     duration

**Example:**

	stop_timeout=2m

**Description:**

Wait for `<duration>` for the task container to exit on a stop before
killing it.

Unset, the container engine default applies.


## Keyword `subset`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true

**Description:**

The name of the subset this resource is assigned to.

Resources of a same driver group and a same subset are ordered and acted upon
together, and are configured as a whole in a `[subset#<group>:<name>]` section,
or in a less precise `[subset#<name>]` one.

That section accepts `parallel`, to act on the members concurrently rather than
one after the other, and the `pg_*` keywords, to place the members in their own
process group.


## Keyword `sysctl`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	convert:     shlex

**Example:**

	sysctl=kernel.shm_rmid_forced=1 net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1

**Description:**

Set namespaced kernel tunables exposed via sysctl in the task container.


## Keyword `tags`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	convert:     set

**Description:**

A whitespace-separated list of tags.

Tags can be used for resource selection by tag.

Some tags can influence the driver behaviour:

* `noaction`

  Skip any state changing action on the resource and imply `optional=true`.

* `nostatus`

  Force the status `n/a`.


## Keyword `timeout`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	convert:     duration

**Example:**

	timeout=5m

**Description:**

Wait for `<duration>` before declaring the task `run` action a failure.

If no timeout is set, the agent waits indefinitely for the task command to exit.


## Keyword `tty`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	convert:     bool

**Description:**

Allocate a pseudo-tty.


## Keyword `type`

	required:    false
	scopable:    false
	rbac:        Requires the root grant, except for the values oci, docker, podman, acme.

**Description:**

The resource driver name.


## Keyword `unprovision`

	required:    false
	scopable:    false
	default:     true
	convert:     bool

**Description:**

Set to `false` to ignore the `unprovision` action on the resource.

> **Warning**: `unprovision` use data-destructive operations like
  formatting.

It is recommended to set `provision=false` on long-lived critical objects,
to force administrators to remove this setting when they really want to
destroy data.


## Keyword `unprovision_requires`

	required:    false
	scopable:    false

**Example:**

	unprovision_requires=ip#0 fs#0(down,stdby down)

**Description:**

A whitespace-separated list of conditions to meet to accept a 'unprovision'
action.

A condition is expressed as `<rid>(<state>,...)`.

If states are omitted, `up,stdby up` is used as the default expected states.


## Keyword `user`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true

**Example:**

	user=guest

**Description:**

The user that will run the command inside the container.

Also support the `<user>:<group>` syntax.


## Keyword `userns`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true

**Example:**

	userns=container#0

**Description:**

Defines the podman container run --userns value.

the 'container#...' values are converted to container:id


## Keyword `utsns`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	candidates:  , host

**Example:**

	utsns=container#0

**Description:**

* empty

  The container has a private utsns.

* `host`

  The container shares the host's hostname.


## Keyword `volume_mounts`

	required:    false
	scopable:    true
	convert:     shlex
	rbac:        Host path mounts in container require the root grant.

**Example:**

	volume_mounts=myvol1:/vol1 myvol2:/vol2:rw /localdir:/data:ro

**Description:**

The whitespace-separated list of `<source>:<containerized mount path>:<mount options>`.

The source is one of:

* `/srv/data`, a directory of the node.
* `volume#1:/etc/nginx`, a directory or a file in the resource `volume#1` of
  the service, a volume or a filesystem, under its mount point.
* `web-cfg/etc/nginx`, a directory or a file in the vol `web-cfg` of the
  namespace, under its mount point.

When the source is a directory of the node, the default `<mount option>` is `rw`.

When the source is in a volume, the default `<mount option>` is taken from the
volume access.
