The package post-installation steps are handled by the ``<OSVCROOT>/bin/postinstall`` script. This script can be safely executed on a node where OpenSVC is already installed.

On Unix systems, if the root account has no rsa key, a 2048 bits rsa key is generated by the package post-install. A production node key must be trusted on all nodes of its cluster (PRD and DRP), whereas the keys of disaster recovery servers must not be trusted by any production nodes. This setup is used for rsync file transfers.
