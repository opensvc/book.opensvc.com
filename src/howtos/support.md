## Premium Support

Nodes under a Premium support contract must be tagged in the associated collector to ensure proper node identification and billing.

**Tag the node for premium support:**

```bash
om node collector tag attach --name PREMIUM_SUPPORT
```

**Untag the node for premium support:**

```bash
om node collector tag detach --name PREMIUM_SUPPORT
```

**Verify the current support classification:**

```bash
om node collector tag show
```

> **Note:** Services running on a Premium supported node are implicitly included in the Premium support scope and billing.

Please get in touch with us for any questions you may have.
